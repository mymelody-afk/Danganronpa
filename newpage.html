In 2007, Kazutaka Kodaka wanted to create something original because, he kept making sequals of existing franchises. He gave a game proposal to producer Yoshinori Terasawa, with a general outline of <i>"15 teenagers killing time or our 7 days survival war</i>. At this early stage of development, emails sent between Kodaka and Terasawa thinking of the idea of <i>"Psychopop Highschool Detective Mystery"</i>. The idea was firm in Kodaka's head, a visual novel involving, highschool students survival murder mystery solving. However, the more gruesome aesthetic for Distrust would have been more darker than, what we have today (Danganronpa). Instead of having the iconic hot pink blood, we would have red blood.
